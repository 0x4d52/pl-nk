need to sketch out a delay unit architecture

it needs to be able to implement:

- simple delay (no feedback)
- delay with feedback control (comb)
- multitap delay (using single delay buffer)
- multitap delay with individual feedback controls (using single delay buffer)
- allpass delay


- make the delay unit a proxy?
