   \section Introduction

   This is the documentation for the <tt>libopusfile</tt> C API.

   The <tt>libopusfile</tt> package provides a convenient high-level API for
    decoding and basic manipulation of all Ogg Opus audio streams.
   <tt>libopusfile</tt> is implemented as a layer on top of Xiph.Org's
    reference
    <tt><a href="https://www.xiph.org/ogg/doc/libogg/reference.html">libogg</a></tt>
    and
    <tt><a href="https://mf4.xiph.org/jenkins/view/opus/job/opus/ws/doc/html/index.html">libopus</a></tt>
    libraries.

   <tt>libopusfile</tt> provides serveral sets of built-in routines for
    file/stream access, and may also use custom stream I/O routines provided by
    the embedded environment.
   There are built-in I/O routines provided for ANSI-compliant
    <code>stdio</code> (<code>FILE *</code>), memory buffers, and URLs
    (including "file:" URLs, plus optionally "http:" and "https:" URLs).

   \section Organization

   The main API is divided into several sections:
   - \ref stream_open_close
   - \ref stream_info
   - \ref stream_decoding
   - \ref stream_seeking

   Several additional sections are not tied to the main API.
   - \ref stream_callbacks
   - \ref header_info
   - \ref error_codes*/

/**The metadata from an Ogg Opus stream.

   This structure holds the in-stream metadata corresponding to the 'comment'
    header packet of an Ogg Opus stream.
   The comment header is meant to be used much like someone jotting a quick
    note on the label of a CD.
   It should be a short, to the point text note that can be more than a couple
    words, but not more than a short paragraph.

   The metadata is stored as a series of (tag, value) pairs, in length-encoded
    string vectors, using the same format as Vorbis (without the final "framing
    bit"), Theora, and Speex, except for the packet header.
   The first occurrence of the '=' character delimits the tag and value.
   A particular tag may occur more than once, and order is significant.
   The character set encoding for the strings is always UTF-8, but the tag
    names are limited to ASCII, and treated as case-insensitive.
   See <a href="http://www.xiph.org/vorbis/doc/v-comment.html">the Vorbis
    comment header specification</a> for details.

   In filling in this structure, \a libopsfile will null-terminate the
    #user_comments strings for safety.
   However, the bitstream format itself treats them as 8-bit clean vectors,
    possibly containing NUL characters, so the #comment_lengths array should be
    treated as their authoritative length.

   This structure is binary and source-compatible with a
    <code>vorbis_comment</code>, and pointers to it may be freely cast to
    <code>vorbis_comment</code> pointers, and vice versa.
   It is provided as a separate type to avoid introducing a compile-time
    dependency on the libvorbis headers.*/

    ensure that it looks enough like Opus that it isn't going to be recognized
    as some other format (except possibly an Opus stream that is also
    multiplexed with other codecs, such as video).

/**\name Functions for seeking in Opus streams

   These functions let you seek in Opus streams, if the underlying source
    support it.
   Seeking is implemented for all built-in stream I/O routines, though some
    individual sources may not be seekable (pipes, live HTTP streams, or HTTP
    streams from a server that does not support <code>Range</code> requests).

   op_raw_seek() is the fastest: it is guaranteed to perform at most one
    physical seek, but, since the target is a byte position, makes no guarantee
    how close to a given time it will come.
   op_pcm_seek() provides sample-accurate seeking.
   The number of physical seeks it requires is still quite small (often 1 or
    2, even in highly variable bitrate streams).

   Seeking in Opus requires decoding some pre-roll amount before playback to
    allow the internal state to converge (as if recovering from packet loss).
   This is handled internally by <tt>libopusfile</tt>, but means there is
    little extra overhead for decoding up to the exact position requested
    (since it must decode some amount of audio anyway).
   It also means that decoding after seeking may not return exactly the same
    values as would be obtained by decoding the stream straight through.
   However, such differences are expected to be smaller than the loss
    introduced by Opus's lossy compression.*/

/**\name Functions for decoding audio data

   These functions retrieve actual decoded audio data from the stream.
   The general functions, op_read() and op_read_float() return 16-bit or
    floating-point output, both using native endian ordering.
   The number of channels returned can change from link to link in a chained
    stream.
   There are special functions, op_read_stereo() and op_read_float_stereo(),
    which always output two channels, to simplify applications which do not
    wish to handle multichannel audio.
   These downmix multichannel files to two channels, so they can always return
    samples in the same format for every link in a chained file.

   If the rest of your audio processing chain can handle floating point, those
    routines should be preferred, as floating point output avoids introducing
    clipping and other issues which might be avoided entirely if, e.g., you
    scale down the volume at some other stage.
   However, if you intend to direct consume 16-bit samples, the conversion in
    <tt>libopusfile</tt> provides noise-shaping dithering API.

   <tt>libopusfile</tt> can also be configured at compile time to use the
    fixed-point <tt>libopus</tt> API.
   If so, the floating-point API may also be disabled.
   In that configuration, nothing in <tt>libopusfile</tt> will use any
    floating-point operations, to simplify support on devices without an
    adequate FPU.*/

                          least 120 ms of data at 48 kHz per channel (11520
                          values total).
                         Smaller buffers will simply return less data, possibly
                          consuming more memory to buffer the data internally.
                         If less than \a _buf_size values are returned,
                          <tt>libopusfile</tt> makes no guarantee that the
                          remaining data in \a _pcm will be unmodified.
   \return The number of samples read per channel on success, or a negative
            value on failure.
           The number of samples returned may be 0 if the buffer was too small
            to store even a single sample for both channels, or if end-of-file
            was reached.
           The list of possible failure codes follows.
           Most of them can only be returned by unseekable, chained streams
            that encounter a new link.
   \retval #OP_EFAULT        An internal memory allocation failed.
   \retval #OP_EIMPL         An unseekable stream encountered a new link that
                              used a feature that is not implemented, such as
                              an unsupported channel family.
   \retval #OP_EINVAL        The stream was not fully open.
   \retval #OP_ENOTFORMAT    An unseekable stream encountered a new link that
                              that did not have any logical Opus streams in it.
   \retval #OP_EBADHEADER    An unseekable stream encountered a new link with a
                              required header packet that was not properly
                              formatted, contained illegal values, or was
                              missing altogether.
   \retval #OP_EVERSION      An unseekable stream encountered a new link with
                              an ID header that contained an unrecognized
                              version number.
   \retval #OP_EBADPACKET    Failed to properly decode the next packet.
   \retval #OP_EBADTIMESTAMP An unseekable stream encountered a new link with
                              a starting timestamp that failed basic validity
                              checks.*/
